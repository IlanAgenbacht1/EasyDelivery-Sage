- Record all activity, especially errors.

- Discrepancy activity that can be used to track and manage any discrepancies. Driver can select an issue from a list of common discrepancies with minimal or no input needed. 
  Capture an image depending on the issue. Can then enable a validation override.

- Settings screen for certain variables like location validation distance, offline only mode etc. (Perhaps these are hardcoded per customer?)

- Scanning barcode with camera when capturing parcels.

- Keep completed documents in header dashboard (can be colored green and set to unclickable). Once all deliveries are done the app will automatically sync. 
  If no internet, driver can trigger it manually once he has an internet connection (If the app doesnt pick up the connection automatically).
