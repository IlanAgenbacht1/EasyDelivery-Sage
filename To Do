UI

BACKEND
- Change the way InProgress trips are checked. At the moment a started trip is only validated against a devices local data. The device that moves a trip to inprogress should be the only one capable of removing it from that folder. 
  Can add the ability to display in progress trips, however they can only be accessed by the device that transacted against it.

! BUGS !
- Strange behaviour when going into discrepancy mode whilst in barcode scanning mode.
- Adapter attempting to read delivery count of a trip file whilst its still being downloaded.
- Rate limit exception - likely not an issue. Can be solved by combining some sync threads to reduce simultaneous api calls.


TESTING
- Log/track database behaviour. Avoid unneccessary data.
