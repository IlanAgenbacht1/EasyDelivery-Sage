UI

FUNCTIONALITY
- Change the way InProgress trips are checked. At the moment a started trip is only validated against a devices local data.

- When syncing data after app comes online for first time (deliveries are completed offline), trip status isnt updated correctly (trip is never moved to InProgress) and trip isnt correctly completed.

- Upgrade database version to force dropping and creating new db when pushing out new build.

- Change the way trip files are read to match how they are written in ED Manager
