UI

FUNCTIONALITY
- Change the way InProgress trips are checked. At the moment a started trip is only validated against a devices local data.

- When syncing data after app comes online for first time (deliveries are completed offline), trip status isnt updated correctly (trip is never moved to InProgress) and trip isnt correctly completed.
