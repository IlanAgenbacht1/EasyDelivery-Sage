FUNCTIONALITY
- Change the way InProgress trips are checked. At the moment a started trip is only validated against a devices local data. The device that moves a trip to inprogress should be the only one capable of removing it from that folder. 
- From the trip dash, create an independant return record as a json file with customer, reference, item code/parcel, qty, comment.


! BUGS !
- Trip jsons not downloading correctly when created through ED manager. File is generated and uploaded correctly. Very unlikely to be an issue with ED manager.
- Strange behaviour when going into discrepancy mode whilst in barcode scanning mode.

- Rate limit exception - likely not an issue. Can be solved by combining some sync threads to reduce simultaneous api calls.
