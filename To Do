UI
- Redo dash layout.

- Remove new/exit screen after completing delivery. Return to updated header dash.


FUNCTIONALITY
- Exporting data.

- Capturing of data when completely offline. IE no schedule. 
  - Add/Plus/New button in dash header that appears only when no schedule is found (or the existing schedule is completed) and internet cannot be accessed.
  - All fields can be edited when capturing parcels. Once completed, data is inserted into a seperate ("CustomDelivery" or "OfflineDelivery") table which can then be validated at a later stage.
