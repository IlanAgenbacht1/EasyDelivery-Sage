FUNCTIONALITY
- Add emails to SyncService

- Completed trips that aren't fully synced due to code not fully executing for whatever reason:
  - Create a TripSync table that records amount of orders and amount of orders that have synced. Once both columns equal one another, sync and ensure data in DropBox is correct.
  - Only delete data from table once Dropbox is correctly synced.
