UI

FUNCTIONALITY
- Change the way InProgress trips are checked. At the moment a started trip is only validated against a devices local data.

- When syncing data after app comes online for first time (deliveries are completed offline), trip status isnt updated correctly and trip isnt correctly completed.

- Seperate build for capturing temperature.
  - Add a 'Capture temperature' button between image and signature capture buttons.


! BUGS !
- Green tick showing validated parcels appears randomly on big parcel lists. Occurs when most of the items are validated and the remaining few randomly appear to be validated. (Android 9)
