UI

BACKEND
- Change the way InProgress trips are checked. At the moment a started trip is only validated against a devices local data. The device that moves a trip to inprogress should be the only one capable of removing it from that folder. 
  Can add the ability to display in progress trips, however they can only be accessed by the device that transacted against it.

! BUGS !
- Trip jsons not downloading correctly when created through ED manager. File is generated and uploaded correctly. Very unlikely to be an issue with ED manager.
- Strange behaviour when going into discrepancy mode whilst in barcode scanning mode.

- Rate limit exception - likely not an issue. Can be solved by combining some sync threads to reduce simultaneous api calls.


TESTING
- Log/track database behaviour. Avoid unneccessary data.
